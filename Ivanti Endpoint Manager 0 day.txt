0 Day Discovery Report — Ivanti Endpoint Manager / Portal Endpoint Information Disclosure
Author: Daniel C. Ulman 
Date of discovery: January 2024

==========================================

Confidentiality / Ownership
This observation was made during targeted vulnerability research under nondisclosure terms. All related findings, documentation, and derived materials remain confidential and the property of Carson Saint. This report contains only descriptive and non-actionable information; all proof-of-concept code and network captures have been redacted in accordance with internal policy and NDA restrictions.

==========================================

Executive Summary
In early 2024, while analyzing exposed Ivanti (formerly Avanti) web service interfaces, an anomalous behavior was discovered on a portal endpoint associated with Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM).
The endpoint returned structured error messages containing internal server paths, build identifiers, and service-component names when accessed with a crafted unauthenticated request.
At the time of observation, no public advisory or CVE reference existed for this condition, giving the finding potential zero-day significance.
Subsequent Ivanti advisories later described similar issues, validating the class of vulnerability initially detected.

==========================================

Scope & Context
• Target: Ivanti Endpoint Manager / Portal web interface (HTTP service).
• Environment: Uncredentialed testing of publicly reachable endpoints.
• Method: Manual header and parameter manipulation to assess authentication and input-validation behavior.

==========================================

Technical Findings
• A specific unauthenticated HTTP GET and POST combination triggered verbose diagnostic output from a service endpoint.
• Returned data included:
– Internal file-system and API paths.
– Exact product and module versions.
– Stack-trace fragments identifying .NET assemblies and function names.
• The behavior indicated missing access-control enforcement and improper error-handling configuration.
• No exploit execution or payload injection was performed; testing stopped after verifying the disclosure.

==========================================

Proof of Concept (High-Level Summary)
• A crafted unauthenticated request to the portal service produced a deterministic diagnostic response.
• Returned headers and JSON fields revealed internal component names (e.g., Ivanti.PortalServices and AppServer/handlers).
• The condition was confirmed using standard HTTP tools in a controlled lab environment only.
• All reproduction artifacts remain restricted under NDA.

==========================================

Impact
• Primary risk: Disclosure of internal system paths, module versions, and stack information that could assist targeted exploitation.
• Likelihood: High where diagnostic mode or debug handlers are exposed without authentication.
• Severity: Medium to High depending on deployment context and adjacent vulnerabilities.

==========================================

Remediation & Outcome
• The condition was documented and reported to Carson Saint for responsible disclosure.
• Shortly after, Ivanti published advisories covering similar exposure patterns (CVE-2024-21887 and related issues).
• The finding was validated internally as a precursor class to those advisories.
• No active exploitation was performed and no customer systems were affected.

==========================================

Recommended Mitigation
1. Enforce strict authentication and role-based authorization for all portal and EPM API endpoints.
2. Disable verbose debug or stack-trace output in production configurations.
3. Review error-handling routines to ensure no internal path or version data is returned to clients.
4. Apply latest Ivanti security updates and validate against known CVE fixes.
5. Monitor web logs for unauthenticated access attempts to portal service handlers.
